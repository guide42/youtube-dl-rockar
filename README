Usage
-----

    youtube_dl_rockar [-h] artista [disco]

This only works with argentinean artists found in the rock[dot]com[dot]ar
site. It will retrieve artists discography and download the songs using
youtube-dl. If the `disco` argument is not provided, will download the whole
discography.

The output format is::

    {artist}/{albumyear} - {album}/{num} - {song}.{ext}

Where `artist` is the given artist name, `album` the name of the given album
or each album name retrieved. The filename is composed of the position of the
song in the album padding with a zero, the name of the song and the extension
given by the codec (usually m4a).
