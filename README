youtube-dl. If the `disco` argument is not provided, will download the whole
discography.

The output format is::

    {artist}/{album}/{num} - {song}.{ext}

Where `artist` is the given artist name, `album` the name of the given album
or each album name retrieved. The filename is composed of the position of the

given by the codec (usually m4a).
